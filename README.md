# Instructions

Once you've clicked the start button, you'll have 15 seconds to answer the question. If you've answered correctly, you'll receive a correct response on the answer page. Guess wrong, and the game will reveal the correct answer. 

You'll have 5 seconds to get ready for the next question, but if you can't wait, you can manually retrieve it. 

The game will currently ask you up to 4 questions, randomly selected from the trivia pack (currently only 8 questions available). No question will be repeated per game. 

When the game is over, you can hit the restart button to try again. The game will restart without the page reloading.
